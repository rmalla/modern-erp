# Modern ERP System - Complete Overview

## System Purpose & Business Workflow

The Modern ERP system is designed to handle a specific business workflow:

1. **Customer Orders** → Issue **SALES ORDER**
2. **Sales Order** → Create **PURCHASE ORDER(S)** to vendor(s) 
3. **When ready to ship** → Generate **SALES INVOICE + PACKING LIST** (combined document)
4. **Optional**: Generate **PACKING LABELS** from the same document

### Key Business Requirements

## Contact and Address Management System

### Architecture Overview
**Comprehensive contact and address management system implemented across all document types**

#### Key Components:

2. **BusinessPartnerLocation Model**: Address management with multiple addresses per business partner
3. **Document Integration**: All sales and purchasing documents support dual-contact system

#### Dual-Contact System:
**Every document (Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, Invoices, Shipments) includes:**
- **Internal User**: Our company contact handling the document
- **External Contact**: Customer/vendor contact for the document

#### Smart Filtering:
- **Contact Dropdown**: Automatically filtered by selected business partner after save
- **Address Dropdowns**: All address fields (bill_to, ship_to, etc.) filtered by business partner
- **Admin Workflow**: Save document with business partner → Edit again → See filtered options

#### Admin Interface:
- **Contact Information Section**: Internal user + external contact dropdowns
- **Address Information Section**: Business partner location, bill_to, ship_to addresses
- **Help Text**: Clear instructions for users on filtering behavior
- **Form Validation**: Prevents invalid contact/address combinations

#### Implementation Details:
- **DocumentContactForm**: Custom Django form class handling filtering logic
- **No JavaScript**: Simple server-side filtering after document save
- **Consistent Pattern**: Same implementation across Sales, Purchasing, and all document types
- **User-Friendly**: Clear messaging about save-first-to-filter workflow

## Business Logic & Utilities

### Sales Order Manager (`/sales/utils.py`)
**Comprehensive business logic for multi-vendor purchase order generation**

#### Key Functions:
- `analyze_purchase_requirements()`: Analyzes what needs to be purchased, grouped by vendor
- `generate_purchase_orders()`: Creates multiple POs automatically from SO requirements
- `get_status_summary()`: Comprehensive status tracking
- `create_customer_order_from_data()`: Order intake from external sources

#### Multi-Vendor Logic:
```python
# Example: One SO line may need items from multiple vendors
# SO Line: 100 units of Product X
# Vendor A: 60 units (primary vendor)
# Vendor B: 40 units (secondary vendor)
# Result: 2 separate POs generated automatically
```

## Views & Workflow

### Sales Views (`/sales/views.py`)
1. **Dashboard**: Status overview of all sales orders
2. **Order Intake**: Customer order entry form
3. **Purchase Order Generation**: Multi-vendor PO creation from SO
4. **Shipping & Invoicing**: Combined invoice/packing list generation

### URL Patterns (`/sales/urls.py`)
- `/dashboard/`: Main sales overview
- `/intake/`: New order entry
- `/generate-pos/<uuid>/`: PO generation for specific SO
- `/ship-invoice/<uuid>/`: Combined shipping/invoicing

## Data Migration

### 📊 Technical Implementation Details

#### **Workflow States & Colors**
```
- Draft (Gray #6c757d) - Initial editable state
- Pending Approval (Orange #fd7e14) - Awaiting manager approval  
- Approved (Teal #20c997) - Ready for processing
- In Progress (Blue #0d6efd) - Being worked on
- Complete (Green #198754) - Finished work
- Closed (Dark Gray #495057) - Final archived state
- Rejected (Red #dc3545) - Needs revision
```

#### **Field Locking Logic**
```python
EDITABLE_STATES = ['draft', 'rejected']
LOCKED_STATES = ['pending_approval', 'approved', 'in_progress', 'complete', 'closed']

# Locked fields include:
- Business Partner, Opportunity, Dates
- Customer PO, Payment Terms, Incoterms  
- Contact Information, Addresses
- Order Lines (quantities, products, prices)
```

#### **Permission System**
```python
WORKFLOW_PERMISSIONS = [
    'approve_sales_orders',      # Can approve pending orders
    'submit_for_approval',       # Can submit orders for approval
    'reactivate_documents',      # Can reactivate completed orders
    'approve_purchase_orders',   # Future: PO approvals
    'approve_invoices'           # Future: Invoice approvals
]
```
